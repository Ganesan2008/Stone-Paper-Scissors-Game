# Stone, Paper, Scissors Game

## 🎲 Introduction
Welcome to the Stone, Paper, Scissors Game! This is a simple yet fun browser game where you can test your luck and strategy against the computer. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this game is easy to play and accessible from any modern web browser.

### 🎯 Objective
The objective of the game is to select either stone, paper, or scissors and compete against the computer's choice in a classic match. The rules are straightforward:
- Stone beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Stone

## 🚀 How to Play
Upon loading the game, you will be greeted with a prompt asking if you're ready to play. If you choose 'OK', you will then be asked to select Stone, Paper, or Scissors through another prompt. The game will then compare your choice with the computer's random selection and declare a winner.

### Game Flow
1. Confirm you're ready to play.
2. Input your choice (Stone, Paper, Scissors).
3. The game compares your choice against the computer's.
4. A winner is declared, and you are asked if you'd like to play again.

## 📝 Technical Overview
This game is implemented using basic JavaScript, showcasing fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Conditional Statements (`if/else`)
- Random Number Generation (`Math.random()`)
- Loops and Control Flow
- Event Handling and User Interaction (`prompt`, `alert`, `confirm`)

### Key Features
- **User Interaction**: Utilizes `confirm` and `prompt` for engaging user input and feedback.
- **Random Computer Choice**: Implements `Math.random()` to simulate the computer's choice.
- **Game Logic**: Employs conditional statements to determine the game's outcome based on the rules.

## 🔄 Playing Again
The game offers the option to play again once a round is completed. Selecting 'OK' will refresh the game, allowing for continuous play without manual reload.

## ❗ Invalid Input Handling
The game also includes checks for invalid inputs, ensuring that the player selects one of the three valid options (Stone, Paper, Scissors) or chooses to exit the game.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- **GUI Implementation**: Incorporating a graphical user interface for a more interactive experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Adding a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- **Multiplayer Option**: Allowing two players to play against each other.
